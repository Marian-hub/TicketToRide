# FRONTEND 

Since this projects requires me to create graphics using React  such as simple rectangles or points and even simple animations so I decided to use a simple but complete framework [Konva](https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html).<br/>
Also I would like to avoid writing css or any styling I'm going to use [semantic-ui-react](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
